            <p>In sailing there are two ways to race: Fleet Racing, where it's every boat against every boat.
                Team Racing where it's three boats against another three boats at a time. 
                This is where you will learn more about Team racing and the difference betweeen fleet and team racing.
            </p>
            <h2>Here are some pictures of what the boats look like</h2>
