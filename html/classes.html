                    <p>The C420 is called a club 420, it's name, 420, comes from it's length, of being 420 cenemeters, which is around 13ft 9in, and weighs around 220-300lbs. 420s have three sails, the jib sail, main sail, and a symmetrical spinnaker, along with a trapeze rig. The trapeze allows the crew to hook onto it while wearing a harness, to help keep the boat flat when the wind picks up. The spinnaker is used for downwind sailing, there are two types of spinnakers, asymmetrical, and symmetrical, which 420s use.</p>

                    <p>The CFJ (Class Flying Junior) is a double handed boat. Two people are needed to sail this boat. The crew, who sits more forward in the boat, handles the jib sails, which is the smaller sail on the front of the boat, along with being in charge of the other lines that are able to change the sail shape. The skipper, who sits farther back in the boat, handles the main sail and the tiller, which is how the boat turns. The FJ fleet is a very popular boat for highschool and college sailing. FJ's are 13.5ft long, and are very often made of fiberglass. They are a good starter boat and many sail camps use them to teach beginner sailors.</p>

                <div class="content">
                    <p>ILCA 7, also known ass a 'full-rig' laser. The full-rig is 7 square meeters and is the biggest sail size made for lasers. The ILCA 7 was the first sail size made for lasers, but now there is a suggested weight to be sailing it. The recommended minimum weight to be sailing a full-rig comfortably is about 160 lbs (about 72 kg). Of course you do not have to be the recommended weight to be sailing a full rig, but it might be harder to keep it flat when sailing in higher winds. In more serious regattas, you might get your weight checked to make sure you are in the correct weight class for your sail size. All laser hulls are about 13ft 10in, the only thing differentiating the ILCA classes are sail size. Lasers use a rigging where there are four parts to the sail, the sail itself, the boom, the top section, and the bottom section, each sail size uses different bottom sections.</p>

                    <p>ILCA 6, also known as the radial laser. The radial sail is the 'medium' size sail for the laser, the 6 in the name 'ILCA 6' stands for the sail size being 6 square meeters. Radial lasers have a recommended weight for sailing comfortably is around 130-160 lbs. ILCA 6 is the most popular fleet in the laser class, as many youth and women are within the weight range and can sail radial sails comfortably without having to worry about being too light to keep the boat flat in heavier winds or being too heavy in lighter winds. All laser hulls are about 13ft 10in, the only thing differentiating the ILCA classes are sail size. Lasers use a rigging where there are four parts to the sail, the sail itself, the boom, the top section, and the bottom section, each sail size uses different bottom sections.</p>

                    <p>ILCA 4, also known as a 4.7 laser, is the smallest sail size that lasers come in. The 4 in the name ILCA 4 stands for the sail size being 4.7 square meeters. ILCA 4 has a recommended weight range of about 100-130 lbs. The 4.7 sail size is a good size for youth to start in as they are commonly past Opti sailors who have grown too big to be able to compete in the Opti classes. All laser hulls are about 13ft 10in, the only thing differentiating the ILCA classes are sail size. Lasers use a rigging where there are four parts to the sail, the sail itself, the boom, the top section, and the bottom section, each sail size uses different bottom sections.</p>
