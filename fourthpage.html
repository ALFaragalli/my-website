    <p>One of the ways to race a sailboat is <b>Fleet Racing</b>. The most noticeable thing about fleet racing that differenciates it from team racing, is that boats sail one against all.</p>
    <p>Fleet racing is the type of racing you would most likely start off doing if you decide to join a sailing team, or even if you race bigger boats like a keel boat.</p>
